# doom-beer-finder

The idGames Beer Pairing Finder queries the [idGames Archive database](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/) using [their API](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/api/ "idGames Archive API"), finds a match in the [Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Entryway) to grab an image gallery, and then suggests a beer pairing to go with it, using the [Ontario Beer API](http://ontariobeerapi.ca/).

This was made as my second project for the Accelerated Javascript course at the Juno College of Technology. I hope you enjoy it! It is, after all, very important to know what to drink while you are Doom-ing.
